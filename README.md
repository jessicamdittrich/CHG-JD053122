# Weather Dashboard

## Objective
The objective was to create a searchable weather dashboard using multiple API's to gather certain information and place it into the UI.

## Approach
My approach began with drawing out the UI to help ensure that the requirements would be met. I then wrote out my anticipated step by step process for the Javascript portion. This included researching Open Weather Map and the requirements needed to "fetch" the API. It was determined with a classmate that a geo location (geoapifty) API was also needed to get a city's latitude and longitude which is a requirement for the Open Weather Map API to function accordingly. Once this was all thought through, I began my coding journey.

## Reflection
Following the completion of this project I took a step back to look at the end result. It is still a goal for me to refine my code and use the philosopy of creating many small functions that work great. I did not meet this goal but on the other end, the code works.
